## UI For Docker

UI For Docker is a web interface for the Docker Remote API.  The goal is to provide a pure client side implementation so it is effortless to connect and manage docker.

### Goals
* Minimal dependencies - I really want to keep this project a pure html/js app.
* Consistency - The web UI should be consistent with the commands found on the docker CLI.

### Quickstart
1. Run: `docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock uifd/uifordocker`

2. Open your browser to `http://<dockerd host ip>:9000`



Bind mounting the Unix socket into the UI For Docker container is much more secure than exposing your docker daemon over TCP. The `--privileged` flag is required for hosts using SELinux. You should still secure your UI For Docker instance behind some type of auth. Directions for using Nginx auth are [here](https://github.com/kevana/uifordocker/wiki/uifordocker-with-Nginx-HTTP-Auth).

### Specify socket to connect to Docker daemon

By default UI For Docker connects to the Docker daemon with`/var/run/docker.sock`. For this to work you need to bind mount the unix socket into the container with `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`.

You can use the `-H` flag to change this socket:

    # Connect to a tcp socket:
    $ docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --privileged uifd/uifordocker -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375

### Change address/port UI For Docker is served on
UI For Docker listens on port 9000 by default. If you run UI For Docker inside a container then you can bind the container's internal port to any external address and port:

    # Expose UI For Docker on 10.20.30.1:80
    $ docker run -d -p 10.20.30.1:80:9000 --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock uifd/uifordocker

### Access a Docker engine protected via TLS

Ensure that you have access to the CA, the TLS certificate and the TLS key used to access your Docker engine.  

These files will need to be named `ca.pem`, `cert.pem` and `key.pem` respectively. Store them somewhere on your disk and mount a volume containing these files inside the UI container:

```
$ docker run -d -p 9000:9000 uifd/uifordocker -v /path/to/certs:/certs -H tcp://my-docker-host.domain:2376 -tlsverify
```

If you want to specify different names for the CA, certificate and public key respectively you can use the `-tlscacert`, `-tlscert` and `-tlskey`:

```
$ docker run -d -p 9000:9000 uifd/uifordocker -v /path/to/certs:/certs -H tcp://my-docker-host.domain:2376 -tlsverify -tlscacert /certs/myCA.pem -tlscert /certs/myCert.pem -tlskey /certs/myKey.pem
```

*Note*: Replace `/path/to/certs` to the path to the certificate files on your disk.
